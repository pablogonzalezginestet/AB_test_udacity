# A|B test: randomized experiment and matched pair analysis

##  A|B test analizes whether a change applied to an experimental group is statistically different from a control group (where the change has not been applied to).

## In the Jupyter Notebook,  I work on two examples based on the course 'A/B Testing for Business Analysts' at Udacity.
